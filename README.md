## A Programm for estimating Heart Rate with Video

In this task, a video I recorded with my laptop-camera was analyzed to estimate heart rate based on the average intensity of a specific skin area. The process involved extracting frames from the video, identifying a region of interest (ROI), analyzing the average intensities within that area, and detecting peaks, which were used to calculate heart rate. Using the Python programming language and libraries such as OpenCV and NumPy, this workflow was implemented and the results visualized.
